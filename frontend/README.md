# Metagenomic Visualization 

Welcome to the **Meta Vis**. This application provides an interactive platform for visualizing results from metagenomic analysis.

**Note**: This README is for the front-end application.

The front-end is built using the following technologies:

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing for the creation of reusable components and a responsive user experience.
- **Vite**: A modern build tool that offers fast development and optimized production builds, enhancing the development experience with instant hot module replacement and quick builds.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that improves code quality and maintainability through type checking and advanced editor features.
- **Ant Design (antd)**: A comprehensive design system and UI component library that provides a set of high-quality React components out-of-the-box, facilitating the creation of a consistent and professional user interface.
